# 044.ssh自动登陆（无密码）

`ssh`自动登陆服务器，不需要输入密码，适合服务器集群间互通。  
`SSH`被玩毁了，一些狮友的搜商已经无法搜到ssh自动登陆了 :)

## Notes

SSH Without a Password

The following steps can be used to ssh from one system to   
another without specifying a password.

  * The system from which the ssh session is started 
    via the ssh command is the client.
  * The system that the ssh session connects to is the server.
  * These steps seem to work on systems running OpenSSH.
  * The steps assume that a DSA key is being used. 
    To use a RSA key substitute 'rsa' for 'dsa'.
  * The steps assume that you are using a Bourne-like 
    shell (sh, ksh or bash)
  * Some of this information came from:
    http://www.der-keiler.de/Mailing-Lists/securityfocus/
    Secure_Shell/2002-12/0083.html


## Steps:

1. On the client run the following commands:

``` bash
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
$ chmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa -f $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa -P ''
#This should result in two files, 
#$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa (private key) and 
#$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub (public key).
```
2.Copy $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to the server.

3.On the server run the following commands:

``` bash
$ cat id_dsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2
$ chmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2

#Depending on the version of OpenSSH the following 
#commands may also be required:

$ cat id_dsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

#An alternative is to create a link from 
#authorized_keys2 to authorized_keys:

$ cd $HOME/.ssh
$ ln -s authorized_keys2 authorized_keys
```

4.On the client test the results by ssh'ing to the server:

`$ ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa server`

5.(Optional) accept host key

``` bash
for ip in $SERVER_IP; do
    ssh-keygen -R $ip
    ssh-keyscan -H $ip >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
done
```

This allows ssh access to the server without having to specify   
the path to the id_dsa file as an argument to ssh each time.


## Helps:

  * ssh(1)
  * ssh-keygen(1)
  * ssh_config(5)
